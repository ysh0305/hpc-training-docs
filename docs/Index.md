# Introduction

Welcome to the **SDSC HPC & Cyberinfrastructure Training Tutorials**.

This site is a centralized training hub for high-performance computing (HPC) and cyberinfrastructure (CI) education at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC). It provides structured, hands-on learning materials designed to help users work effectively with SDSC systems, services, and modern research computing workflows.

Our goal is to make SDSC’s computing resources more accessible by guiding users through practical examples, best practices, and foundational concepts that support real-world research and technical work.
