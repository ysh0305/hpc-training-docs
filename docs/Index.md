# Introduction

Welcome to **HPC Training Documentation**.

This site serves as a central hub for a growing collection of high-performance computing (HPC) training series developed for SDSC users. The materials are organized into themed learning tracks that range from introductory concepts to more advanced HPC workflows and tools.

Whether you are completely new to HPC or looking to deepen your technical skills, this documentation provides structured, hands-on guidance for working effectively on modern supercomputing systems.

## What you’ll find here

This training portal currently includes multiple tutorial series, each targeting different aspects of HPC usage and best practices, such as:

- **HPC Basic Skills** — foundational Linux and Expanse usage
- **Interactive Computing on Expanse** — running and managing interactive jobs  
- **Jupyter on Expanse** — using notebooks in an HPC environment  
- **GitHub at SDSC** — version control and collaborative workflows  
- *(More series to be added over time as the curriculum expands.)*

:::tip Learning paths
Each series is designed as a coherent learning path, but you are free to jump directly to any module that matches your current needs or interests.
